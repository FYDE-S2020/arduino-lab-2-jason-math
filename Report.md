## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    IP Addresses are used to give each device a unique ID that can be used to send, track, and receive data.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    A Domain Name Service maps a symbolic name to an IP address. It is useful so we don't have to memorize 32-bit addresses.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP addresses do not change, while dynamic IP addresses do.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    UDP is connectionless and faster but has the potential to be lossy while TCP is slower but lossless.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event-based, meaning the user's interaction updates the state. Using delay would cause timing issues within the code.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    Functions are called "blocking" if they do not allow other code to be executed while being executed.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Interrupts allow for the processor to choose what code to run based on interrupt priority.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface defines how a user can call and interact with the code, while implementation defines the functionality of the code. This is important because these are separate ideas, one is determined by the developer while the other is determined by the programmer.
